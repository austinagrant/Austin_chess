This is my personal project
I am translating and improving on my work in school making a Java Chess player
We were able to get the Player to look 6 moves in advance, I would live to be able to get there with python

I' currently working on all of the move generation, which works on bit manipulation. I have changed my school code to be more memory efficient, even though python is not being very fast
Any ideas would be welcome

If you are here you should be able to figure it out, run game.py and it should simulate some moves, not all the pieces are added and no check detection or anything.

Currently I am trying to figure out why it is running slow even only with 2 pieces, and make 1 move at a time, it is still really slow while the java version could have all the pieces at depth 6
I am not sure why it is so slow, might be considering to many moves or maybe is not pruning

TODO:
    2 piece per side @ depth 6
